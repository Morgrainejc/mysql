#☆big countries
select name,population,area
from World
where population > 25000000 or area > 3000000

#☆swap salary
update salary
set sex = if(sex = 'f','m','f')

#☆not boring movie
select *
from cinema
where description !='boring' and (id%2) = 1
order by rating desc

#☆duplicate emails
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(*) >1 #where过滤整体，having过滤组，where必须在group by 之前

#☆combine two tables
select person.firstname as FirstName,person.lastname as LastName,address.city as City,address.state as State
from person
left join
address
on person.personid = address.personid

#☆☆Employees Earning More Than Their Managers,
select name as Employee
from 
(select a.name,a.salary as a_salary,b.salary as b_salary   #join的表不能有重复列名
from employee as a
left join employee as b                                   
on a.managerid = b.id) as c                                #join的表用作select from对象必须赋名
where c.a_salary > c.b_salary                              #这里不能写a.a_salary > a.b_salary,因为新的表叫c，这两个不存在了

#更好的方法，select多个表
select E1.Name 
from Employee as E1, Employee as E2 
where E1.ManagerId = E2.Id and E1.Salary > E2.Salary       #关联两表并筛选

#☆☆Customers Who Never Order
select name as Customers
from(
select a.id as a_id,a.name,b.customerid
from customers a
left join
orders b
on a.id = b.customerid) c
where c.customerid is null                                 #is null，不能写=null

#更好的方法
SELECT A.Name from Customers A
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Orders B WHERE A.Id = B.CustomerId)

SELECT A.Name from Customers A
LEFT JOIN Orders B on  a.Id = B.CustomerId
WHERE b.CustomerId is NULL

SELECT A.Name from Customers A
WHERE A.Id NOT IN (SELECT B.CustomerId from Orders B)

#☆☆Rising Temperature（方法很好，量表关联的查询）
select w1.id
from weather w1,weather w2
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature
and to_days(w1.date)-to_days(w2.date)=1                    #to_days返回日期在今年的天数

#☆Classes More Than 5 Students
select class from courses
group by class
having count(distinct student)>=5                          #distinct，列出所有不同的值，（select distinct A from）

delete from email
where id in (select id from email group by email having count(*) >1)
and id not in (select min(id) from email group by email having count(*)>1 )   #注意，in后面的查询不能命名

#☆☆☆☆Delete Duplicate Emails（多表关联删除，注意不能同时对一张表进行select和delete）(该题在本地和leetcode上运行结果不一致）
DELETE person from person,(
SELECT * FROM person
where id not in (select id FROM person GROUP BY email )) as a 
where person.id = a.id

#更好的方法
delete p1
from person p1,person p2
where p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id

#查找最大值
select *
from employee
where salary = (select max(salary) from employee);        #注意等号的右边不能直接写max（salary）

#☆☆Second Highest Salary
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from (select * from employee where salary != (select max(salary) from employee)) b   #max如果不存在会返回null

#更好的方法
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary                          #limit：读取几行；offset：从第一行往后推几行开始读取

#☆☆☆☆☆Exchange Seats（多表关联，注意from后的select不能直接写count（*）as counts）
select 
(case
    when mod(id,2) =1 and id != counts then id+1
    when mod(id,2) =1 and id = counts then id
    else id-1
    end) as id,student 
from seat,(select count(*) as counts from seat) a
order by id asc

#☆☆☆☆☆rank scores
select 
    Score,
    @rank:= @rank+(@pre<>(@pre:=score)) Rank              #@定义局部变量，：=传递外部参数
from 
    (select score from scores ) s,
    (select @rank:=0,@pre:=-1) init                       
order by score DESC                                       #order by尽管是在查询结果之后运行，但是局部变量也会跟着变化（自己解释），为了避免错误，还是直接写到上面的式子中

#☆☆☆☆☆consecutive numbers
select distinct                                           #需要加distinct，否则可能会打印相同的数字
     num as ConsecutiveNums
from
(select 
    num,
    @conse:= @conse+(@pre<>(@pre:=num)) fre
from
    logs,
    (select @conse:=0,@pre:=0) a
group by fre
having count(*)>=3) conse
